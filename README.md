# AmazonSalesAnalysisDashboard
Here I am presenting a Power Bi dashboard showing details about customer sales analysis of an E-commerce website.
Once the data is gathered, next step is to clean the data,transform the data by removing unwanted columns and creating new measures using Dax functions to apply directly on the dashboard and proceed with the data modelling by creating relation between orders & details table with reference of common column.
As i get raw data so data cleaning is a very important step in this project because it deals with majority of issues , because if you give clean and readable data it became very easy for developer to build interactive dashboard with ease and get best insights of business.
